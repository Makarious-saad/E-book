Project Scope:
The e-books platform web application has been created to bring together more than one publishing house worldwide to save time and effort when searching for a specific book.
Also we have been concerned with providing the best and easiest ways to buy books by paying through an immediate outlet available in all stores at the level of Egypt in order to facilitate the customer to pay the dues of purchase orders instead of using the credit card.
We have also provided resale of books used to benefit materially from selling them instead of storing them and making it possible for any user to view their books and that books will not be required to be displayed through the publishing house only.
The system has been programmed and planned following the directives of the engineers and doctors of the City of Culture and Science.
